this is one of the problems i met today, i wanted to download MIT Linear algebra course
but the download links where laggy and slow and they were alot i didn't want to click each link of the 30 link
So i made a python script to download the links automatically 
I uploaded it so if anyone faces the same problem can just use it

CAREFUL
all the links are visible is the script so you can verify them with the main website download links
verify them before running the script to avoid downloading harmful files on your device
